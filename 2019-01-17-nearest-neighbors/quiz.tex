This quiz will count toward your grade -- 1 point if you get the
correct answer.

Here are $n=5$ data with $p=2$ input dimensions. Each row is a person
for which we have measured the height (first column of $X$, in
centimeters), weight (second column in pounds). The output $y$ that we
want to predict is diabetes diagnosis status ($y$, 0=no diabetes,
1=diabetes).

\begin{equation*}
  X = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
              170 & 140 \\
              200 & 160 \\
              180 & 200 \\
              140 & 150 \\
              150 & 130
\end{array}\right],\ 
  y = \left[\begin{array}{c}
              0 \\
              0 \\
              1 \\
              1 \\
              1
\end{array}\right],\ 
  d = \left[\begin{array}{c}
              \underline{\hspace{1cm}}\\
              \underline{\hspace{1cm}}\\
              \underline{\hspace{1cm}}\\
              \underline{\hspace{1cm}}\\
              \underline{\hspace{1cm}}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation*}

The goal is to compute the class predicted by the $K=3$ nearest
neighbor model, for a new/test person with features $x$=[height = 160 cm,
weight = 130 pounds].

Assume that we use the Manhattan/L1 distance metric,
\begin{equation*}
  d(x,x') = \sum_{j=1}^p |x-x'|
\end{equation*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fill in the blanks in the vector of distances $d$ above (each
  row should be the Manhattan/L1 distance between the new/test person
  and the training data).
\item Which are the three nearest neighbors? (write a star* for each
  of the three nearest neighbors in the blank next to the
  corresponding distances/rows)
\item What is the overall predicted class? (0 or 1)
\end{enumerate}
